Learn DAO,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/learn-dao,,2022-06-17,day,1-10,"What is LearnDAO? The ultimate decentralized company. -Academy: there are already many blockchain/nfts/metaverse academies but all in a traditional format without practical use of technology as such, that is why LearnDAO, in addition to the traditional format, brings training FROM the Metaverse as a novelty, entering with a token gating system to through NFTs that are purchased with the DAO token, thus giving use to the token. There is a big problem in the industry and it is that the events on the Metaverse are in person without meeting needs such as the elimination of geographical barriers and saving money and time; That is why LearnDAO launches its line of ""Metaverse World Summit"" events developed entirely from the metaverse with the ability to host up to 10,000 users (in collaboration with Vatom) in the same virtual space, also using the token through the same system. of token gating and NFT tickets purchased with the DAO token. We are developing the first e-commerce on the different platforms of the metaverse, this line of business of the DAO is with more long-term vision to position ourselves before anyone else and when there really is a volume of global purchases in the metaverse, take advantage of the new trend . Also giving use to our token by buying items through it. On the other hand, all those NFT tickets need to be traded on a marketplace platform and that is why we also launched our own NFT marketplace with a variant of it that focuses exclusively on NFT items from the metaverse (like Sketchfab but NFTized), giving the possibility for any member of the DAO to list complete 3D rooms even for someone to buy it and place it on their land in the compatible metaverse(s) in question. We believe in the power of the community and that is why we want to empower ours by creating a launchpad in which DAO member projects can launch (after a selection vote by the DAO) In addition to these business models, we have the almost mandatory governance and voting platform in any DAO, and a token staking model to encourage long-term holding. The token is also deflationary, increasing its value over time. In addition to these business models, we want to be one of the first crypto ecosystems to carry out a corporate social responsibility model, through a small fee in each transaction (1-2% of each purchase or sale will be converted to BUSD and will pass to an RSC wallet), we are going to carry out a model of buying NFTs that are worthless or belong to scams because we believe that there is a big problem in the NFT sector since we are experiencing a superinflation of useless NFTs, the prices will be symbolic but they will return part of what was lost to any person who is part of the DAO or not, with all those useless NFTs we will burn them at a given moment and form a single mural NFT with all of them, the largest NFT made up of useless NFTs or scam of the world, and we will take it to auction, thus adding value to the entire NFT sector and generating a good marketing campaign for our ecosystem through said action. Conclusion: why invest in LearnDAO and not in any metaverse platform such as decentraland, sandbox or others? because over the years they will become obsolete and most users will be on more current platforms; our ecosystem by developing ON the main metaverses and being dynamic allows us to adapt at all times to new trends.","Blockchain, Cryptocurrency","Madrid, Madrid, Spain",,,,The Ultimate Decentralized Company,"204,961",2022-11-12,Seed,1,Pre-Seed,,,

PentoPix,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pentopix,,2021-08-17,day,1-10,"Stories are all around us. A good story is powerful, it moves us, inspires action, takes us on a journey. Stories are not just entertainment, without a good story there is no success.  Storyboards are the most commonly used tool to visualise the story scene by scene, pre-produce it and plan for shooting. Although it is a crucial part of any production, storyboarding is a long and expensive process, therefore it is only done at the final stages.  To put things in perspective, for an average 1 mins video it takes about a week to complete the storyboard. PentoPix is a platform that allows creative teams to maximise their storytelling abilities. The platform automatically visualises structured text (like scripts) in a 3D form. Unlocking a new dimension of creativity. PentoPix is a web-based creative suite, build for remote and collaborative work models. PentoPix uses a natural language parser, splitting the sentences into verbs & nouns, and visualises it in a 3D form using Machine Learning and AI. The bespoke AI model of PentoPix creates spatially and orthographically correct pre-visualisations. We start with generating 3D storyboards, with scene-by-scene visualisations. And aim to develop the platform further to unlock automatic animation creation. PentoPix is designed to be the next evolutionary platform for creative industries. The scripts written or uploaded to PentoPix are formatted according to the industry standard. Teams can work collaboratively on the storyline across text, visual and schema modules, with changes  With the rise of Augmented and Virtual realities, and, most recently, the buzz around the Metaverse. Creative Teams face a new set of challenges. As now everything needs to be created in 3D, ready to be viewed from any angle. For example, like with Augmented Reality, thats catching up now, it still takes months and hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce. PentoPix unlocks creative freedom for teams of all sizes and backgrounds. With AI-powered text-to-3D visualisations, it is easier than ever to imagine, plan and share ideas for new mediums. PentoPix produces detailed storyboards, allowing studios and agencies to explore the riskiest of ideas while ensuring consistency, actionability and clear communication across the team.  With the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix & Amazon Prime, the demand for great stories are higher than ever. PentoPix helps creators to write & develop great stories. And it assists readers (film studios) in screening the scripts & ideas, making an informed decision about investing time & effort into reading.

The entire platform is structured as a product management marketplace. Blockchain technology is used by ANIMA for the purposes of tracking, authentication of physical products and digital sales. Once the design products to be digitized have been selected with partners; ANIMA creates a token in blockchain by matching it with a digital certificate representing a physical asset. This certificate takes on the value of the digital identity of the product itself; it represents its guarantee, enhances its creative process, history and tracks its movements.  Thanks to the ANIMA platform, users will be able to store their digital products and derive all possible information from them. In fact, within the digital certificate will be countless data and information regarding the product to make the identity of the good even more specific.

In “Ranked Mode” tournaments, only the best players will share the rewards (RCN token) and make profit. The higher you rank, the more you will participate in major tournaments. The RCN prizes up for grabs increase as the level of the tournament in which you participate increases. THE GAME Raccoon Fantasy is a collectible and customizable one-on-one card game: - 4x4 arena - Turn based - Best of 3 - NFTs NFTs - Game cards are player-owned NFTs. As such they are unique and can be put on sale in the shop. - Magic, materials and potions are used to increase the value of the cards or to fuse cards together. - In the shop you can buy new Raccoon cards or put them on sale. You can also buy materials, potions and wearable NFTs for the metaverse. METAVERSE Each land has a defined maximum Raccoon capacity. Raccoons placed on your grounds cannot be used in game decks, as they are engaged in mining RCN. In the lands you will be able to meet and interact with other players in the future and they will be the beginning of the Raccoon Fantasy metaverse. Lands can be purchased in ETH or USD. The lands are plots of land based on NFT technology and can be sold on the marketplace. TOKENOMICS The economy of our ecosystem will be based on two types of trading currencies: - $RCN, utility and governance token. $RCNs will be released with a predetermined schedule over the 60 months following the TGE. - $UVA, in-game token. The $UVA tokens will be assets derived from the farming of the $RCN token through the liquidity providing mechanism. Providing liquidity to pools generates $UVA tokens that can be used to unlock unique NFTs.
